    "content": "he would be better off asleep on some friend’s couch\n\na shadow of the man he was a creeping clause in an agreement he forgot he signed,\n\na sign of life. a bothersome decline, a brotherly embrace. to face\n\nthe man you have become would take a lot, to answer his unblinking eyes not more\n\nnot less than all. i do suppose we crawl to life, day after day he plays the game, a trigger\n\nhappy way to go about,\n\nit’s about time to grow into a different thing, an alien visage i’ve seen, it’s come to me in\nwaking,\nnot in dream. it said hello\n\nand then it disappeared. the seams of my facade are being pecked at, what a start\n\nto something new. who knew i’m through with it, who knew i had no say. to medicate the mind,\n\nto spew the falsehoods of today not from the square but tongue to ear. i hear you,\n\ni do hear the whispers, so you know, and yet i do not twitch. to grow not old,\n\nbut patient is the curse of time. to losing sight of the divine he drinks and cries\n\nand he collapses into bed. although so much is gone it has not fled,\n\nit has walked out. no doubt you might have seen its slow away, like business men who know\n\nthe deed is done walk to the fountain once it has begun."
